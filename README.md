# Format-Pester

Powershell module for documenting Pester's results. 

All the formating work is done by the module [PScribo](https://github.com/iainbrighton/PScribo).

Reports are generated base on a custom PowerShell object returned by Invoke-Pester. You have to provide the parameter `PassThru` to Pester. Currently, NUnit style files generated by Pester are not supported.

If you can't generate report on a computer where tests are executed please save tests results piping them to `Export-Clixml`.

You can be interested also in the [ReportUnit](https://github.com/reportunit/reportunit) tool. It's a report generator for the test-runner family. It uses stock reports from NUnit, MsTest, xUnit, TestNG and Gallio and converts them into HTML reports with dashboards.

## Report example

You can find more examples [here](/examples/).

## Supported languages

Since version 1.3.0 internationalization of generated reports is supported. It means that reports parts e.g. section names, columns headers, etc. can be wrote in a different language than English.

Currently available languages are:

- en-US - English United States - main language
- pl-PL - Polish

If you would like to add support for your language please read the section [Information for translators](https://github.com/equelin/Format-Pester/wiki/Information-for-translators) in the project's wiki.

# Requirements

- Powershell v.4.x
- [Pester](https://github.com/pester/Pester)
- [PScribo](https://github.com/iainbrighton/PScribo)

# Usage

Format-Pester is a PowerShell module so it as to be imported before using it - you can find more instructions in the [wiki](https://github.com/equelin/Format-Pester/wiki/Importing-Format-Pester).

## Example 1

```PowerShell
  Invoke-Pester -PassThru | Format-Pester -Path . -Format HTML,Word,Text
```

This command will document the results of the Pester's tests. Documents will be stored in the current path and they will be available in 3 formats (.html,.docx and .txt).

## Example

```PowerShell
    Invoke-Pester -PassThru | Export-Clixml -Path .\Test-Result.xml

    Import-Clixml -Path .\Test-Result.xml | Format-Pester -Format .\ -BaseFileName Test-Result -Format HTML -FailedOnly
```

You can run the first command on a server where PScribo and Format-Pester are not installed. The tests results object will be stored in a xmf file.

After copying the file to the computer where PScribo and Format-Pester are available you can generate a report. In this example, the HTML file will be generated with results of failed tests only.
